## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/self.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" style="width:200px" /></span>

My name is Kevin Kolk. I'm a Sysadmin who can code.   I'm worked in both the public and private sector over the course of my career and have at one time worn almost every hat in IT.  I've been a developer, DBA, network engineer, security engineer.  Above all else though I consider myself part of the "Ops" side of the DevOps team.  I work out of my home office in Kalamazoo, Michigan for the [SJ Technologies](http://sjtechcorp.com/), **but this blog, its content and opinions are my own.**
